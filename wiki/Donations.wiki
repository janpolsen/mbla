#summary Donations

= Donations =
All plugins I have made and might make in the future are and will continue to be completely *free*. The plugins were primarily ment for personal use, but I thought that if I needed a plugin to do a specific task, then there might be others who need it as well.

You are always welcome to add a comment with a request and if I like it, then I will add it to my to-do list.

If you find this plugin useful then please consider making a small donation encouraging me to keep developing it - any amount is happily accepted.
