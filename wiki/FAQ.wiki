#summary Frequently Asked Questions

=== Do I need to install a Gravatar plugin in order to use MBLA's Gravatar features? ===
No, MBLA is a stand alone plugin, which doesn't require any additional plugins to run.

=== I have configured everything, but nothing happens on my comments page ===
  # Have you remembered to configure the HTML page as well?
  # Have you remembered to add the PHP code to your theme template?
  {{{
<?php if(function_exists('MyAvatars')) MyAvatars(); ?>
  }}}

=== I have created/uploaded a cache folder, but it's empty and no avatars are showing up ===
Does the webserver have write access to the cache folder? This can usually be checked (and changed) with a FTP program. If you have created a cache folder specifically to MBLA, then you can safely change the folder permissions to 777 (`rwxrwxrwx`)

=== The avatar does show up on my comments page, but the page looks very messed up ===
Make sure that you use well formed HTML on the HTML option page. Remember to close all HTML tags you use.

=== Can I add these avatars to a page as well as comments? ===
Yes, of course. There are no difference in how you set it up. Just make sure that you configure the HTML on the HTML option page as well as adding the following PHP code to your template page:
  {{{
<?php if(function_exists('MyAvatars')) MyAvatars(); ?>
  }}}

=== How do I use the debug function ===
Navigate to the page you wish to debug and finally add `?debug=xxx` or `&debug=xxx` where `xxx` is your secret debug key to the URL.

This should load the page in debug mode and place a file called `mbla_xxx.log` (where the `xxx` is the name of the current script file you are debugging) in your MBLA cache directory.
