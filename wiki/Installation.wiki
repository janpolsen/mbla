  * If you want avatars on your posts/pages as well, then you need to add the following line to wherever you want the avatar to show up:
{{{
<?php if(function_exists('MyAvatarsNew')) MyAvatarsNew(); ?>
}}}

*If at any point something is messed up, then just click the "Reset to default values" from the Option page.*
