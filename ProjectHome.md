**I have stopped the development of this plugin until further notice. This plugin hasn't been tested with Wordpress 2.7 so I am not sure how it behaves with that release.**

MBLA is an acronym for "MyBlogLog Avatars" and is a plugin for [Wordpress](http://wordpress.org).

It can add [avatars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_%28icon%29) from i.e. [MyBlogLog](http://mybloglog.com) and [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com) to blog posts and comments.

You can easly switch between [MyBlogLog](http://mybloglog.com) and/or [Gravatar](http://gravatar.com) [avatars](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Avatar_%28icon%29). The output is fully CSS and HTML customizable and the plugin comes with a built in cache control - everything is handled through MBLA's own option page.
