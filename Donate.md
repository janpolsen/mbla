All plugins I have made and might make in the future are and will continue to be completely free. The plugins were primarily ment for personal use, but I believe that if I need a plugin to do a specific task, then there might be others who need it as well. Therefor the plugins are available to the public.

You are always welcome to add a question, comment, enhancement request, etc. to the [FAQ](FAQ.md) or [list of issues](http://code.google.com/p/mbla/issues/list) and I will try to deal with them as soon as possible.

If you find this plugin useful then please consider making a small donation encouraging me to keep developing it - even the smallest amount is happily accepted.
